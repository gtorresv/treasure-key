# Password Generator

## Description

This webpage was created to assist anyone that is in need of a random password. This is especially helpful for someone that works at a workplace that requires them to change their password often due to security reasons. Well this password generator can satisfy those requirements and there would be no need to think about what password to come up with.  

## Usage

You can access the webpage through the following link: https://gtorresv.github.io/treasure-key/.
In order to generate a password with this webpage you would just need to click on the generate password button. Once you click on it, there will be a series of prompts that will pop up with questions about what kind of characters you would like to include in your password. Those questions include what kind of length you want your password to be. The length ranges from 8 to 124 characters. Once you enter a number, if you do not choose a number between 8-124 then a popup box will come out alerting you to try again and choose a length between 8 to 124 characters. The other questions are to choose if you want to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numeric characters, or special characters. Once you choose which characters you want to include, the password will be displayed on the page.

I have included a screenshot of the webpage for this repository.
